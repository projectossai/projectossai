# Welcome to the ProjectOSSAI Community Hub üëã

This repository (`projectossai`) is the central place for community interaction regarding **Project Open Source AI (ProjectOSSAI)**.

Think of this repository as our main forum, coordination point, and issue tracker.

## Purpose of This Repository

**Important:** This repository primarily hosts discussions, issues, documentation links, and overall project coordination. **Code development for specific tools happens in separate, dedicated repositories.** You should not expect to find runnable project code here or submit code contributions directly to this repository.

This is where you should come to:

1.  **Get Oriented:** Find links to key project resources, documentation, and **the specific code repositories** where development takes place (links will be added as repositories are created).
2.  **Provide Feedback:** Share your thoughts on the project's direction or specific components.
3.  **Report Bugs:** Inform us about technical issues encountered **in the specific tool repositories**. You can report them here if you're unsure where the tool's repository is.
4.  **Request Features:** Propose new ideas, tools, or enhancements for ProjectOSSAI. This is the designated place for all feature requests, which may lead to new repositories or issues in existing ones.
5.  **Discuss:** Engage in conversations about the project (using the Issues Tab).
6.  **Coordinate:** Participate in planning related to the various ProjectOSSAI tools developed across different repositories.

## Guidelines for Interaction & Issue Submission üìú

To ensure our community is productive and welcoming, please adhere to these guidelines, particularly when creating Issues:

1.  **Be Respectful:** Interact courteously. We value constructive dialogue. Please review our Code of Conduct ([Link to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md - *create this file*]).
2.  **Search First:** Before submitting a new Issue (bug, feedback, feature request), please search existing Issues to avoid duplicates.
3.  **Use Clear Titles:** Summarize the topic concisely (e.g., "Feature Request: Add X functionality", "Bug: Y crashes when doing Z in [Tool Name]").
4.  **Provide Sufficient Detail:**
    * **Bugs:** Specify the tool/repo if known. Include steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, environment info.
    * **Feature Requests:** Describe the problem your idea solves, your proposed solution, and its benefits/use case.
5.  **Use Labels (If Available):** Apply relevant labels like `bug`, `feature-request`, `question`, `feedback`, `discussion` if they have been set up.
6.  **Stay On Topic:** Keep comments within an Issue focused on resolving that specific item.
7.  **Code Contributions:** Code development happens in separate repositories. Pull Requests with code **should not be submitted here.** They belong in the repository containing the specific code being modified.
